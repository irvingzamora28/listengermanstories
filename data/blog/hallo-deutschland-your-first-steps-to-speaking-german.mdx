Here's a breakdown of key areas to focus on at the german A1 level:

| Topic             | Description                                                                                   | Examples                                                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pronunciation** | Mastering the sounds of German letters and letter combinations.                               | Practice sounds like "ch," "√§," "√∂," and "√º."                                    |
| **Greetings**     | Learning basic greetings and farewells.                                                       | _Guten Tag!_ (Good day!), _Auf Wiedersehen!_ (Goodbye!)                          |
| **Numbers**       | Memorizing numbers from 1 to 100.                                                             | _Eins_ (1), _Zwei_ (2), _Drei_ (3), _Zehn_ (10), _Zwanzig_ (20), _Hundert_ (100) |

## Section 2: Building Your Vocabulary - Words Are Your Building Blocks

A strong vocabulary is essential for fluency. Start by learning common words and phrases related to everyday topics like food, family, hobbies, and travel. There are lots of methods when you learn german that can make it more fun!

To solidify your understanding, try the following:

- **Use online resources:** Websites like Deutsche Welle (DW Learn German) offer free grammar lessons and exercises.
