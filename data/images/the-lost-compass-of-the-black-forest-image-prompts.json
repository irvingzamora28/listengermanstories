      "german_text": "Nach Stunden des Wanderns erreichten Herr Gruber und Frau Schmidt ein kleines, **verstecktes** Dorf, tief im Herzen des Schwarzwaldes. Die **Häuser** waren alt und aus dunklem Holz gebaut, mit schönen, geschnitzten **Verzierungen**. Es roch nach frischem Holz und warmem **Brot**. Sie suchten nach einer **Gaststätte**, um sich auszuruhen und etwas zu essen. Die **Sonne** stand schon tief am **Himmel**. Sie fanden den \"Grünen Baum\", eine gemütliche **Herberge** mit einem freundlichen **Wirt**. \"Guten Abend\", sagte der Wirt, Onkel Ernst, mit einem breiten **Lächeln**, als sie eintraten. Sein **Schnurrbart** war groß und freundlich. \"Kann ich Ihnen helfen, Reisende?\" Frau Schmidt erzählte ihm von ihrer **Suche** nach dem verlorenen Kompass. Onkel Ernsts Augen weiteten sich ein wenig. \"Der alte Kompass?\", sagte er leise. \"Ja, die **Geschichte** stimmt. Er gehörte vor langer **Zeit** einem weisen **Ältesten** unseres Dorfes, aber er ging während eines großen **Sturms** verloren.\" Er nickte **nachdenklich**. \"Viele haben versucht, ihn zu finden, aber niemand war **erfolgreich**.\"",
      "english_text": "After hours of walking, Herr Gruber and Frau Schmidt reached a small, **hidden** village deep in the heart of the Black Forest. The **houses** were old and built of dark wood, with beautiful, carved **decorations**. It smelled of fresh wood and warm **bread**. They were looking for an **inn** to rest and eat something. The **sun** was already low in the **sky**. They found \"The Green Tree\", a cozy **inn** with a friendly **host**. \"Good evening,\" said the host, Onkel Ernst, with a broad **smile** as they entered. His **mustache** was large and friendly. \"Can I help you, travelers?\" Frau Schmidt told him about their **search** for the lost compass. Onkel Ernst's eyes widened slightly. \"The old compass?\" he said softly. \"Yes, the **story** is true. It belonged to a wise **elder** of our village a long **time** ago, but it was lost during a great **storm**.\" He nodded **thoughtfully**. \"Many have tried to find it, but no one has been **successful**.\"",
      "prompt": "Character Reference:\nHerr Gruber: Herr Gruber is a robust, elderly man with a weather-beaten face, deep-set kind eyes, and a thick, grey beard that reaches his chest. He always wears sturdy, well-worn leather hiking boots, practical green trousers, a checkered flannel shirt, and a heavy, dark-green wool jacket, often topped with a traditional Black Forest hat adorned with a small feather. He carries a hand-carved wooden walking stick, which is more of a companion than a simple aid. Herr Gruber is deeply connected to the forest, patient, observant, and possesses a vast knowledge of its secrets and creatures, though he can be a bit stoic and reserved at first. He values tradition and the quiet wisdom of nature.\nFrau Schmidt: Frau Schmidt is a spirited woman in her late twenties, with bright, curious blue eyes and a cascade of fiery red hair often tied back in a practical braid or a messy bun. She dresses in durable outdoor clothing: olive green cargo pants, a comfortable but stylish hiking jacket in muted earth tones, and robust, ankle-high hiking boots. She always carries a well-organized backpack filled with maps, notebooks, a compass, and historical texts, along with a pair of binoculars around her neck. Frau Schmidt is enthusiastic, intellectually curious, and determined, sometimes rushing into situations with youthful eagerness but always with good intentions and a keen mind for puzzles. She is passionate about history and natural geography.\nOnkel Ernst: Onkel Ernst is a jovial and stout man in his fifties, with a round, cheerful face, twinkling eyes, and a bushy brown mustache that always seems to be smiling. He wears traditional Lederhosen, a crisp white shirt, a dark vest, and green suspenders, often topped with a small, embroidered cap that sits slightly askew. His hands are strong and skilled from years of carving wood and preparing hearty, traditional meals in his Gasthof kitchen. Onkel Ernst is incredibly friendly, hospitable, a bit superstitious about local forest tales and legends, and always ready to share a story or offer a warm meal. He provides comfort, local wisdom, and a welcoming presence to travelers and locals alike.\n\n        Requirements:\n\n      - Style: 3D Animation similar to modern Pixar or Disney movies\n\n      - Lighting: Bright and cheerful\n3D Animation, Pixar/Disney style, bright and cheerful lighting. A warm, inviting interior of a rustic Black Forest inn crafted from dark, intricately carved wood with beautiful decorations. Golden sunlight from a low sun streams softly through a window, casting a gentle glow. In the foreground, Onkel Ernst, a jovial, stout man with a cheerful, bushy brown mustache and a slightly askew embroidered cap, stands behind a sturdy wooden counter, his twinkling eyes slightly widened in surprise and recognition. He wears traditional Lederhosen, a crisp white shirt, and green suspenders. Facing him, Frau Schmidt, with her fiery red hair tied back in a practical braid and bright, curious blue eyes, leans slightly forward with a determined expression, her binoculars visible around her neck. Behind her, Herr Gruber, robust and stoic with a thick grey beard reaching his chest and wearing a traditional Black Forest hat, calmly leans on his distinctive hand-carved wooden walking stick, observing the exchange. The cozy air smells faintly of fresh wood and warm bread."
