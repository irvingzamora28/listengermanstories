Lisa has bright blue eyes, rosy cheeks, and short, blonde hair with a slight wave. She is wearing a bright pink t-shirt with a friendly cartoon animal on it and denim overalls. Lisa is smiling warmly at Max, her eyes crinkling at the corners, and reaching out a hand gently towards him. She is saying \"Hello Max! You are at home now!\" Her expression is one of pure joy and welcome.\n\nThe background shows a cozy living room. The walls are a soft yellow color. A bright blue sofa with colorful cushions (red, green, and yellow) is visible. A large, round, colorful rug is on the floor in front of the sofa. A window with sheer, white curtains lets in bright, cheerful sunlight. Toys are scattered playfully on the floor, including a stuffed bear, a bright red ball, and a building block tower. The overall lighting is bright and cheerful, casting soft shadows and highlighting the vibrant colors. The scene should evoke a feeling of warmth, comfort, and excitement. The style should be reminiscent of a modern Pixar or Disney animated film, with smooth textures and realistic, yet stylized, character designs."
